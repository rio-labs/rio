    Base class for all Rio components.

    Components are the building blocks of all Rio apps. Rio already ships with
    many useful components out of the box, but you can also subclass
    `rio.Component` to create your own.


    ## Attributes

    `key`: A unique identifier for this component. If two components with the
        same key are present during reconciliation they will be considered
        the same component and their state will be preserved. If no key is
        specified, reconciliation falls back to a less precise method, by
        comparing the location of the component in the component tree.

    `margin`: The margin around this component. This is a shorthand for
        setting `margin_left`, `margin_top`, `margin_right` and `margin_bottom`
        to the same value. If multiple conflicting margins are specified the
        most specific one wins. If for example `margin` and `margin_left` are
        both specified, `margin_left` is used for the left side, while the other
        sides use `margin`. Sizes are measured in "font heights", so a margin of
        1 is the height of a single line of text.

    `margin_x`: The horizontal margin around this component. This is a
        shorthand for setting `margin_left` and `margin_right` to the same
        value. If multiple conflicting margins are specified the most
        specific one wins. If for example `margin_x` and `margin_left` are
        both specified, `margin_left` is used for the left side, while the
        other side uses `margin_x`. Sizes are measured in "font heights", so a
        margin of 1 is the height of a single line of text.

    `margin_y`: The vertical margin around this component. This is a shorthand
        for setting `margin_top` and `margin_bottom` to the same value. If
        multiple conflicting margins are specified the most specific one
        wins. If for example `margin_y` and `margin_top` are both specified,
        `margin_top` is used for the top side, while the other side uses
        `margin_y`. Sizes are measured in "font heights", so a margin of 1 is
        the height of a single line of text.

    `margin_left`: The left margin around this component. If multiple
        conflicting margins are specified this one will be used, since it's
        the most specific. If for example `margin_left` and `margin` are
        both specified, `margin_left` is used for the left side, while the
        other sides use `margin`. Sizes are measured in "font heights", so a
        margin of 1 is the height of a single line of text.

    `margin_top`: The top margin around this component. If multiple
        conflicting margins are specified this one will be used, since it's
        the most specific. If for example `margin_top` and `margin` are both
        specified, `margin_top` is used for the top side, while the other
        sides use `margin`. Sizes are measured in "font heights", so a margin
        of 1 is the height of a single line of text.

    `margin_right`: The right margin around this component. If multiple
        conflicting margins are specified this one will be used, since it's
        the most specific. If for example `margin_right` and `margin` are
        both specified, `margin_right` is used for the right side, while the
        other sides use `margin`. Sizes are measured in "font heights", so a
        margin of 1 is the height of a single line of text.

    `margin_bottom`: The bottom margin around this component. If multiple
        conflicting margins are specified this one will be used, since it's
        the most specific. If for example `margin_bottom` and `margin` are
        both specified, `margin_bottom` is used for the bottom side, while
        the other sides use `margin`. Sizes are measured in "font heights", so
        a margin of 1 is the height of a single line of text.

    `width`: How much horizontal space this component should request during
        layouting. This can be either a number, or one of the special
        values:

        - If `"natural"`, the component will request the minimum amount it
          requires to fit on the screen. For example a `Text` will request
          however much space the characters of that text require. A `Row`
          would request the sum of the widths of its children.

        - If `"grow"`, the component will request all the remaining space in its parent.

        - Please note that the space a `Component` receives during layouting
          may not match the request. As a general rule, for example, containers
          try to pass on all available space to children. If you really want a
          `Component` to only take up as much space as requested, consider
          specifying an alignment.

        Sizes are measured in "font heights", so a width of 1 is the same as
        the height of a single line of text.

    `height`: How much vertical space this component should request during
        layouting. This can be either a number, or one of the special values:

        - If `"natural"`, the component will request the minimum amount it
          requires to fit on the screen. For example a `Text` will request
          however much space the characters of that text require. A `Row`
          would request the height of its tallest child.

        - If `"grow"`, the component will request all the remaining space in its
          parent.

        - Please note that the space a `Component` receives during layouting
          may not match the request. As a general rule for example, containers
          try to pass on all available space to children. If you really want a
          `Component` to only take up as much space as requested, consider
          specifying an alignment.

        Sizes are measured in "font heights", so a height of 1 is the same as
        the height of a single line of text.

    `align_x`: How this component should be aligned horizontally, if it
        receives more space than it requested. This can be a number between
        0 and 1, where 0 means left-aligned, 0.5 means centered, and 1 means
        right-aligned.

    `align_y`: How this component should be aligned vertically, if it receives
        more space than it requested. This can be a number between 0 and 1,
        where 0 means top-aligned, 0.5 means centered, and 1 means
        bottom-aligned.

        Force a rebuild of this component.

        Most of the time components update automatically when their state
        changes. However, some state mutations are invisible to `Rio`: For
        example, appending items to a list modifies the list, but since no list
        instance was actually assigned to th component, `Rio` will be unaware of
        this change.

        In these cases, you can force a rebuild of the component by calling
        `force_refresh`. This will trigger a rebuild of the component and
        display the updated version on the screen.

        Another common use case is if you wish to update an component while an
        event handler is still running. `Rio` will automatically detect changes
        after event handlers return, but if you are performing a long-running
        operation, you may wish to update the component while the event handler
        is still running. This allows you to e.g. update a progress bar while
        the operation is still running.
