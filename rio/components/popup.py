    A container which floats above other components.

    Popups are containers which float above the page when open. This allows you
    to keep your app clean by default, but present additional information or
    controls when needed.

    They take two children: The `anchor` is always visible and positions the
    popup. The `content` is located inside the popup and is only visible when
    the popup is open.

    The location popups appear at can be customized using the `direction`,
    `alignment` and `gap` attributes. Popups will do their best to honor those
    settings, but deviate if necessary to ensure they don't go off-screen.


    ## Attributes

    `anchor`: A component which is always visible and positions the popup.

    `content`: A component which is only visible when the popup is open.

    `position`: The location at which the popup opens, relative to the anchor.

    `alignment`: The alignment of the popup within the anchor. If the popup
        opens to the left or right, this is the vertical alignment, with `0`
        being the top and `1` being the bottom. If the popup opens to the top or
        bottom, this is the horizontal alignment, with `0` being the left and
        `1` being the right. Has no effect if the popup opens centered.

    `gap`: How much space to leave between the popup and the anchor. Has no
        effect popup opens centered.

    `is_open`: Whether the popup is currently open.

    `on_open_or_close`: Triggered when the popup is opened or closed.
