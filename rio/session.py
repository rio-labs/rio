    """
    Represents a single client connection to the app.

    A session corresponds to a single connection to a client. It maintains all
    state related to this client including local settings, the currently active
    page, and others.

    Sessions are created automatically by the app and should not be created
    manually.

    ## Attributes

    `timezone`: The timezone the connected client is in. You can use this to
        display times in the client's local time.

    `screen_width`: How many units the client's screen is wide. Note that this
        is specifically the screen and not the window your app is running in. If
        you're interested in pixels rather than font heights, multiply this
        value with `self.session.pixels_per_font_height`.

    `screen_height`: How many units the client's screen is high. Note that this
        is specifically the screen and not the window your app is running in. If
        you're interested in pixels rather than font heights, multiply this
        value with `self.session.pixels_per_font_height`.

    `window_width`: The width of the client's window in font heights. Like all
        units in Rio, this is measured in font heights.

    `window_height`: The height of the client's window in font heights. Like all
        units in Rio, this is measured in font heights.

    `pixels_per_font_height`: How many pixels a font height is. This can be used
        to convert font heights to pixels or the other way around.

        (Attention web-devs: Note that this are real pixels, as would be on the
        user's screen, not CSS pixels.)

    `scroll_bar_size`: The width (or height if scrolling horizontally) of the
        scroll bar in font heights. This can sometimes be useful if you want to
        align items with those in a scroll container or leave empty space for
        the bar.

    `primary_pointer_type`: The typical way pointer (i.e. mouse, touch, stylus)
        inputs will be made on this device. If this is `mouse`, you can expect
        the user to be able to give precise inputs and hover over elements. If
        `touch` this is likely not the case, and your layout might want to be
        more spacious.

        Possible values are `"mouse"` and `"touch"`.

        Warning: This is the **primary** way pointer inputs will be made. A
            device may well be equipped with a touch screen, a mouse and a pen
            tablet all at the same time. So this value doesn't in any way
            guarantee that no inputs with other devices will be made.

        Warning: This literal shouldn't be seen as complete. Future versions of
            Rio may add additional values as new types of devices get popular.
            Extending this literal is not considered a compatibility break and
            may happen even in minor versions. If you rely on this value, it's
            good practice to add a fallback for unknown strings.


    `base_url`: This is the URL the app's home page is hosted at, as seen from
        the client. So if the user needs to type `https://example.com/my-app/`
        to see the app, this will be `https://example.com/my-app/`. Note that
        this is not necessarily the URL Python gets to see in HTTP requests, as
        it is common practice to have a reverse proxy rewrite the URLs of HTTP
        requests.

    `theme`: The theme that the client is using. If you've passed both a light
        and dark theme into the app, this will be the one which is actually
        used by the client.

    `client_ip`: The IP address of the connected client. Only available when
        running as a website.

    `client_port`: The port of the connected client. Only available when running
        as a website.

    `http_headers`: The HTTP headers sent by the client. This is a read-only,
        case-insensitive dictionary.

    `preferred_languages`: The languages preferred by the client. Use this to
        present content in the most convenient language for your users. The
        values are ordered with the most preferred language first.

        This always contains at least one langauge.

        The values are in the format `language-region`, e.g. `en-US` for
        American English. The full specification is defined in
        [RFC 5646](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5646).

        Displays a custom dialog.

        This function displays a dialog to the user. This will call the `build`
        function and use its result as the content of the dialog. The content
        will be assigned the full size of the screen. This allows you to
        position the dialog yourself, using the align and margin properties of
        your component.

        By default, dialogs are styled similar to cards, hovering above the
        remainder of the content. If you want to take full control and style
        everything yourself, set `style` to `"custom"`. Note that in this
        case you'll probably want to set an alignment on your component so it
        doesn't take up the entire screen.

        Note: Dialogs are useful if you need to show components without
            returning them from the `build` method. A good example is asking for
            confirmation from an event handler, without having to rebuild the
            component. **If you can return components from the `build` method,
            `rio.Popup` is often an easier choice** (set `position` to
            `"fullscreen"` to get a similar look to dialogs).

        Note: If spawning many dialogs (for example when creating one for each
            item inside of a CRUD application) dialogs can be faster than
            `rio.Popup`, because dialogs only have to build their children when
            they're opened, while `rio.Popup` has its children built
            immediately, for every single item in the list.

        The result of this function is an instance of `rio.Dialog`, which can be
        used to interact with the dialog programmatically. For example, you can
        close the dialog or wait for it to be closed.

        Dialogs can store a result value, which can be retrieved by calling
        `Dialog.wait_for_close`. This allows you to easily wait for the dialog
        to disappear, and also get a return value while you're at it. See the
        example below for details.


        ## Parameters

        `build`: A function which creates the component to be displayed in the
            dialog. Please note that this is a function, not a component. You
            can of course pass a component _class_ as this function, as long as
            the constructor doesn't require any arguments.

        `modal`: Whether the dialog should prevent interactions with the rest of
            the app while it is open. If this is set, the background will also
            be darkened, to guide the user's focus to the dialog.

        `user_closable`: Whether the user can close the dialog, e.g by clicking
            outside of it.

        `on_close`: An event handler which is called when the dialog is closed.
            This will not be called if you explicitly remove the dialog by
            calling `dialog.close()`.

        `owning_component`: If provided, the dialog will close automatically
            should the owning component be destroyed. This is useful if you want
            a dialog to disappear when a user e.g. navigates away from the
            current page.

        `style`: Controls the appearance of the dialog. If `"default"`, it's
            styled similarly to a `Card`, hovering above the rest of the app. If
            `"custom"`, no styling is applied at all and your component covers
            the entire screen. Apply an alignment to your component to center it
            instead.

        ## Example

        This example demonstrates how to spawn a custom dialog that allows the
        user to select a value from a Dropdown menu. Once the user selects an
        option, the dialog closes, and the selected value is returned.

        ```python

        Displays a simple dialog with a yes and no button.

        This is a convenience function which displays a simple dialog to the
        user, with a "Yes" and "No" button. The user can select one of the
        options, and the function will return `True` or `False` respectively. If
        the user closes the dialog without selecting an option, `None` is
        returned instead.

        The button texts and colors can be customized.

        ## Parameters

        `title`: A heading to display at the top of the dialog.

        `text`: A markdown string to display below the title. This should
            explain to the user what the dialog is about.

        `icon`: An icon to display next to the title.

        `default`: The option the user is likely to take. This will highlight
            the respective button.

        `yes_text`: The text to display on the "Yes" button.

        `no_text`: The text to display on the "No" button.

        `yes_color`: The color of the "Yes" button.

        `no_color`: The color of the "No" button.

        `owning_component`: If provided, the dialog will close automatically
            should the owning component be destroyed. This is useful if you want
            a dialog to disappear when a user e.g. navigates away from the
            current page.


        ## Example

        Here's a simple example that demonstrates how to spawn a dialog where
        the user can select a boolean value:

        ```python
        class MyComponent(rio.Component):
            selected_value: bool = False

            async def on_spawn_dialog(self) -> None:
                # Display a dialog and wait until the user makes a choice.
                # Since `show_yes_no_dialog` is an asynchronous function, the
                # `on_spawn_dialog` function must also be asynchronous.
                selected_value = await self.session.show_yes_no_dialog(
                    title="This is a Dialog",
                    text="Do you like ice cream?",
                )

                # Store the value, but only if one was selected. If the dialog gets
                # closed without a selection, `selected_value` will be `None`.
                if selected_value is not None:
                    self.selected_value = selected_value

            def build(self) -> rio.Component:
                return rio.Column(
                    rio.Button(
                        "Open Dialog",
                        on_press=self.on_spawn_dialog,
                    ),
                    rio.Text(f"You've selected: {self.selected_value}"),
