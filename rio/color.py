class Color(SelfSerializing):
    """
    A color, optionally with an opacity.

    The `Color` class does exactly what it says on the tin: It represents a
    single color. They're used throughout Rio to specify the color of text,
    fills, and more.

    Internally, colors are stored in the
    [Oklab](https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/) color space, a modern
    color space that is designed to be perceptually uniform. Regardless of the
    internal representation, colors can be created from and converted to a
    variety of different color spaces, including linear RGB, sRGB, and HSV.

    ## Examples

    ```python
    # Color from RGB(A)
    Color.from_rgb(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0)

    # Color from hex
    Color.from_hex("#ff0000")

    # Color from HSV(A)
    Color.from_hsv(0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0)

    # Color from grayscale
    Color.from_gray(0.5, 1.0)

    # Invalid: Don't call `Color` directly
    Color(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0)  # Raises a `RuntimeError`
    ```

    Regardless of how the color was created, all of the color's components will
    be accessible as attributes. For example, you can access `color.rgb`, even
    if the color was created from HSV values.


    ## Attributes

    `BLACK`: A pure black color.

    `GRAY`: A medium gray color.

    `WHITE`: A pure white color.

    `RED`: A pure red color.

    `GREEN`: A pure green color.

    `BLUE`: A pure blue color.

    `CYAN`: A pure cyan color.

    `MAGENTA`: A pure magenta color.

    `YELLOW`: A pure yellow color.

    `PINK`: A pure pink color.

    `PURPLE`: A pure purple color.

    `ORANGE`: A pure orange color.

    `BROWN`: A pure brown color.

    `TRANSPARENT`: A fully transparent color.
