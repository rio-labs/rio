## Before Submitting a Pull Request

The Rio core team will review your pull request and either merge it, request changes, or close it.

### Contribution Prerequisites

-   You have [Python](https://www.python.org/) at `version 3.10 or higher` installed.
-   You have [Rye](https://rye-up.com/) at `version 0.33.0 or higher` installed.
-   You have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) at `version 20.0 or higher` installed.
-   You are familiar with [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

**Before submitting your pull request** make sure the following requirements are fulfilled:

-   Fork the repository and create your new branch from `dev`.
-   Run `rye sync` in the root of the repository.
-   Run `rye run dev-build` in the root of the repository. Or `npm run dev-build` if you are on Windows.
-   Make sure `pre-commit hooks` are installed by running `python -m pre_commit install`.
-   If your contribution fixes an existing issue, please make sure to link it in your pull request.

### Project structure

-   `frontend/` - TypeScript code for the Rio frontend
-   `raw-icons` - In addition to the official material icons, Rio ships with some
    of its own. This directory contains any and all custom icons.
-   `rio/` - Python code for the Rio backend
-   `scripts/` - Contains scripts which are tangentially related to Rio, but not
    used during runtime. For example, you can find benchmarking and publishing
    scripts here
-   `tests/` - Contains tests for Rio

## Development Workflow

While Rio allows users to write apps in 100% Python, Rio itself has both a
Python and a TypeScript component. In order to get started using Rio from the
repository, you'll have to build the typescript Component as well.

### 1. Fork the repository

[Go to the repository](https://github.com/rio-labs/rio) and fork it using your own GitHub account.

### 2. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/rio.git
```

### 3. Install dependencies

Go to the root of the repository and run the setup:

```bash
cd rio
rye sync
rye run dev-build
python -m pre_commit install
```

Rye and npm don't get along well on windows. If the build command above fails,
try to build directly using `npm`:

```bash
npm run dev-build
```

## Miscellaneous

### Repository Organization

We chose to use a monorepo design. This allows us to maintain the whole ecosystem keep it up-to-date and consistent.

We do our best to keep the dev branch as clean as possible, with tests passing at all times. However, the dev branch can move faster than the release cycle. Therefore check the releases on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/rio-ui/) so that you are always up-to-date with the latest stable version.
